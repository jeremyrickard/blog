I'm wrapping up 2017 with an exciting new job at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) working on the super cool [Azure Container Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service/?&WT.srch=1&WT.mc_id=AID559320_SEM_NUBGTQ0d&ef_id=WiXcbAAAATBapIzG:20171207225228:s). I really enjoyed my four years at VMware. I worked on really cool stuff and I worked with some really great people. So why make the change? I had reached a point where I felt like I was ready to do something different and I saw a really intersting job posting on Twitter. In 2015, I went to [dev ops days](https://legacy.devopsdays.org/events/2015-denver/) and saw [@sethgoings](https://twitter.com/sethgoings) give a talk. I went home and looked up his company and saw they were doing really cool stuff. I had just started experimenting with Kubernetes at VMware and thought it would be cool to work there some day. I followed Seth and some other DEIS people on Twitter and eventually saw they were acquired by Microsoft. Fast forward to 2017 and I saw a job posting from Seth that checked off all the cool stuff I wanted to do in job next. I applied and got the job and hit the ground running about three weeks ago. It's been super fun and the team I joined even released the [open service broker for azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/connect-your-applications-to-azure-with-open-service-broker-for-azure/) at Kubecon this year. I obviously came to the party late, but I helped fix some bugs and feel like I've make contributions to the team already!

If you've followed me in the past, you may wonder why I'm here and not at [jrrickard](https://github.com/jrrickard/). That's a great question. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of *_foolishness_*: 

While at VMware, I connected my github account to the VMware org. To do that, I had to enable two factor auth! I enabled two factor auth and happily used github and [duo mobile](https://duo.com/product/trusted-users/two-factor-authentication/duo-mobile) to handle my authenticator needs. I stored my recovery codes in the brand new lastpass account I made with my VMware email address! Then I left VMware without taking those recovery codes out of LastPass. Then I lost access to LastPass. I'm sure you see where this is going. I start my new job and need to connect my github account to the Azure org. It's a very similar process....except I can't login. The codes I'm getting from Duo get rejected by github. I search for my recovery codes but realize I left them in LastPass. Ooops. So here we are, brand new github account...brand new blog. The moral of this story is backup your recovery codes.
